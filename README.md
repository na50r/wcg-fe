# WomboCombo Go - Frontend
This is the frontend code for the WomboCombo Go game, a successor of the original WomboCombo project which was built by a group of students as part of the Sopra Spring 2024 course at the University of Zurich. The original WomboCombo was essentially a clone of the game InfiniteCraft by Neal Agrawal feauturing game modes, daily challenges and achievements. It used TypeScript with React for the frontend. WomboCombo uses Vanilla JS with Vite instead; mainly because I wanted to learn more about how JavaScript and frontend development works.

## Requirements
- Node.js & npm
- Vite
- Extended-EventSource package

## Setup
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
Currently, I deploy it on Vercel, hence `vercel.json`, may change in the future.
